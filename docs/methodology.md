# Labor Market Metrics That Actually Matter

A guide to the quantitative signals that reveal labor market conditions independent of CEO narratives and PR cycles.

## Tier 1: The Core Indicators

These are the metrics most directly relevant to employee leverage and job market conditions.

### Quit Rate
**What it tells you:** Worker confidence in finding better opportunities. The single best proxy for employee leverage—when people voluntarily leave jobs, it means they believe they can do better elsewhere.

**Where to find it:** [BLS JOLTS Report](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)

**Update frequency:** Monthly, released ~5 weeks after the reference month (e.g., October data released in early December)

**Key thresholds:**
- 3.0%+ = Strong employee leverage (Great Resignation territory)
- 2.5% = Healthy, balanced market
- 2.0% = Employer-favorable, workers staying put
- 1.8% = Current level (Jan 2026), lowest since 2014 outside pandemic

**What to watch:** Three consecutive months of upward trend signals returning employee confidence. This is your leading indicator for when job-hopping becomes rational again.

---

### Job Openings per Unemployed Worker
**What it tells you:** The supply/demand balance in the labor market. Above 1.0 means more jobs than job-seekers; below 1.0 means workers are competing for scarce positions.

**Where to find it:** Calculate from [JOLTS data](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/) (job openings) and [Employment Situation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm) (unemployment level)

**Also available pre-calculated:** [FRED Series JTSJOL/UNEMPLOY](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Lpi3)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Key thresholds:**
- 2.0 = Peak employee leverage (March 2022)
- 1.5 = Strong employee market
- 1.2 = Balanced
- 1.0 = Current approximate level, tilting employer-favorable
- Below 1.0 = Definitively employer-favorable

---

### Hires Rate
**What it tells you:** Actual hiring velocity, not just job postings. Companies can post jobs without filling them; the hires rate shows real movement.

**Where to find it:** [BLS JOLTS Report](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Current context:** Hires rate at levels not seen since 2013, indicating a "frozen" market where neither hiring nor firing is happening at normal rates.

**What to watch:** Sustained increase in hires rate (not just openings) signals actual labor market thaw.

---

### Layoffs and Discharges Rate
**What it tells you:** Involuntary separations. When combined with quit rate, tells you whether the market is "low-churn stable" (low quits, low layoffs) or "deteriorating" (low quits, rising layoffs).

**Where to find it:** [BLS JOLTS Report](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Current context:** Layoffs have been edging up while quits remain depressed—a warning sign that the "low-hire-low-fire" equilibrium may be breaking toward deterioration.

---

## Tier 2: Macro Context

These shape the environment in which labor market dynamics play out.

### Federal Funds Rate
**What it tells you:** Cost of capital, which drives corporate hiring/investment decisions. High rates favor incumbent large firms; low rates enable disruption and employee mobility.

**Where to find it:** [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm)

**Update frequency:** FOMC meets 8 times per year; decisions announced same day

**Current level:** 3.5%-3.75% (as of December 2025)

**Your thesis connection:** You predicted rate cuts would precede AI bubble deflation and eventually enable employee-favorable conditions. Rates have come down 75bps in 2025; watch for continued easing trajectory.

---

### Unemployment Rate
**What it tells you:** Headline labor market health, though it's a lagging indicator and misses nuance (doesn't capture underemployment, labor force exits, etc.)

**Where to find it:** [BLS Employment Situation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm)

**Update frequency:** Monthly, first Friday of each month (usually)

**Current level:** 4.6% (November 2025), up from 4.0% in January 2025

**Limitation:** Can improve for "bad" reasons (people leaving labor force) or worsen for "good" reasons (discouraged workers rejoining to search). Always pair with participation rate.

---

### Labor Force Participation Rate (Prime Age: 25-54)
**What it tells you:** Whether working-age adults are engaged with the labor market at all. Declining participation can mask true unemployment.

**Where to find it:** [BLS Employment Situation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm) or [FRED Series LNS11300060](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**What to watch:** Declining participation alongside rising unemployment is a worse signal than either alone.

---

### Average Hourly Earnings Growth (YoY)
**What it tells you:** Whether workers have pricing power. Strong wage growth = employee leverage; decelerating wage growth = employer leverage.

**Where to find it:** [BLS Employment Situation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Current level:** ~3.5% YoY (November 2025), lowest since May 2021

**Context:** Wage growth has been decelerating as labor market tightens. Real wage growth (nominal minus inflation) is the more meaningful number.

---

## Tier 3: Sentiment and Leading Indicators

These are squishier but can provide early signals before hard data moves.

### Job Seeker Confidence Index (ZipRecruiter)
**What it tells you:** How job seekers feel about their prospects—a leading indicator of quit rate changes.

**Where to find it:** [ZipRecruiter Economic Research](https://www.ziprecruiter-research.org/job-seeker-confidence)

**Update frequency:** Quarterly

**Current context:** At lowest level since survey began in 2022; pessimism about market but individual confidence in skills remains high.

---

### Indeed Job Postings Index
**What it tells you:** Real-time job posting volume, more current than BLS data.

**Where to find it:** [Indeed Hiring Lab](https://www.hiringlab.org/)

**Update frequency:** Weekly

**Advantage:** Much faster than government data; useful for spotting trend changes early.

---

### Conference Board Consumer Confidence (Jobs Hard to Get)
**What it tells you:** Consumer perception of job availability—sentiment indicator.

**Where to find it:** [Conference Board](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Key context:** "Jobs hard to get" hit 20% in August 2025, highest since early 2021.

---

### Challenger Job Cuts Report
**What it tells you:** Announced layoffs by US employers, broken down by industry and stated reason.

**Where to find it:** [Challenger, Gray & Christmas](https://www.challengergray.com/blog/)

**Update frequency:** Monthly

**Limitation:** Measures announcements, not actual separations. But useful for tracking what reasons companies are claiming (AI, restructuring, etc.)

---

## Tier 4: Fed Watch

For tracking monetary policy trajectory.

### FOMC Dot Plot
**What it tells you:** Where Fed officials expect rates to go.

**Where to find it:** [Federal Reserve Economic Projections](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20251210.htm)

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (March, June, September, December meetings)

---

### CME FedWatch Tool
**What it tells you:** Market-implied probabilities of Fed rate changes at upcoming meetings.

**Where to find it:** [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)

**Update frequency:** Real-time

## Creating a Personal Dashboard

### Monthly check (first week of month):
- [ ] Employment Situation report (unemployment, wage growth, participation)
- [ ] Previous month's JOLTS (quit rate, hires rate, openings)
- [ ] Indeed Hiring Lab update

### Quarterly check:
- [ ] ZipRecruiter Job Seeker Confidence
- [ ] Fed dot plot (after March/June/Sept/Dec meetings)
- [ ] Challenger year-to-date layoff totals

### Watch for these signals of returning employee leverage:
1. Quit rate trending up for 3+ consecutive months
2. Job openings per unemployed climbing back above 1.2
3. Hires rate increasing (not just openings)
4. Wage growth accelerating
5. Fed cutting rates meaningfully (toward 3% or below)
6. Job seeker confidence indices turning up

### Your timeline thesis checkpoints:
- **Mid-2026:** Check if quit rate has begun recovering from 1.8% floor
- **Late-2026:** Assess post-midterm political stability and Fed trajectory
- **Mid-2027:** Your original target for employee-favorable conditions—evaluate all indicators
- **Late-2027/2028:** Adjusted target given Venezuela uncertainty

## Data Disruption Note (January 2026)

The federal government shutdown disrupted BLS data releases in late 2025. October 2025 household survey data was not collected; some releases have been delayed or combined. Check [BLS announcements](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release-calendar.htm) for current status of data availability.
